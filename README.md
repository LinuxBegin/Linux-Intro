# Linux-Intro
An easy to understand guide that explains what Linux Really IS. I'll cover all the basics like Desktop Environments, Package Management and Terminal customisation, because my job is to make Linux easy for you.

NOTE: If you're an average non-tech savy user i'd suggest looking into my profile and discover other guides to make things a whole lot simpler. They will vary, taking into account all of the most popular and functional Linux distributions.

# What really is Linux?
Well it's not really an operating system rather a kernel, the very core of an OS that allows hardware-software integration and link. The Linux Kernel (That's it's real name) if Free and Open source, meaning anyone can change it anywhere, anyhow, and anytime. This, compared to proprietary kernels used by Windows and MacOS, makes it more secure, well-tested, lightweight and reliable. Now you might be thinking, "If it's so cool then why isn't it popular?". It is, just not in the desktop market. Other than that every era and profesion of today's technological world is enveloped by Linux.

# Why do people call it an OS?
They don't!. They just use it as a term as refrence to every distribution (distro for short) ever made using this Kernel. "Wait. what do you mean by distributions?" well since anyone can use it, combine it with all other main components of a Linux OS their is an infinite number of Linux Oses that can come into existence. But don't worry, there are something only like 30-40 distros that you can even use, and serve a purpose.

# Distro Family Tree
In terms of heiarchy there are 3 types of Linux distros:<br>
1. Base  2. Independent 3. Deriative

# 1. Base distributions:
Independent distros that directly use GNU Linux and over time serve as the base for other distros to come into existence fall into this category. There are three main Base distros: Debian, Arch and Fedora.
