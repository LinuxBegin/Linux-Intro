# Linux-Intro
An easy to understand guide that explains what Linux Really IS. I'll cover all the basics like Desktop Environments, Package Management and Terminal customisation, because my job is to make Linux easy for you.

NOTE: If you're an average non-tech savy user i'd suggest looking into my profile and discover other guides to make things a whole lot simpler. They will vary, taking into account all of the most popular and functional Linux distributions.
