# Linux-Intro
An easy to understand guide that explains what Linux Really IS. I'll cover all the basics like Desktop Environments, Package Management and Terminal customisation, because my job is to make Linux easy for you.

NOTE: If you're an average non-tech savy user i'd suggest looking into my profile and discover other guides to make things a whole lot simpler. They will vary, taking into account all of the most popular and functional Linux distributions.

# What really is Linux?
It's not an Operating System(OS), rather a kernel. The base software needed to make an OS. So why do people, when comparing windows and Linux, say "Switch to Linux". This is because the Linux Kernel is open-source which means anyone can create an OS, so people say the term "Linux" as in, an OS, is to describe all of its distributions. Linux distros consist of the following components:

# 1. Package Management:
Package management is split into three types:
(a) Native (b) Universal (c) Containerized

# (a) Native:
Native refers to the use of a distro's packaging format. This specific format remains consistent across the same base, but before we continue and dive deeper lets first understand the Linux OS hierarchy, which is split into 3 types:
1. Independent
2. Base
3. Deriative
